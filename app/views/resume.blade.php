                                    <p>The LAN stack was incorrectly wired, in an obviously rushed manner, upon originally being installed. This caused many outages and downtimes for repair and maintenance of the stack.

This lead to an increased productivity rate, eased the stress of mass device management and increased the efficiency rates of port usage in the stacks.</p>
